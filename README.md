## Usage

The usage of this study guide is fairly simple. Almost all the information is displayed directly on the page, with the topics and their various bullet points seperated out. Some extra information and interactivity is stored on the DevTools console (JavaScript).

In the console, it will list the topics we have learned and choose one topic for us to study first.
