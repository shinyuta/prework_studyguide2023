        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You typically use HTML at the beginning to give structure.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage. They can include text, image, header, and list elements.</li>
          <li>The common element types that are used to divide and describe a page are Meta-related, content division, and semantic elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The ul. ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You  use CSS to give the content style.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. </li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: add code to current working branch. -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "text": describes what the commit contains and commits the changes</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: to double check if our local branch is in sync with the base branch. Important to make sure you aren't working on outdated code.</li>
          <li>git push origin branch/name: used to push changes to our remote github branch</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You use JavaScript to handle the logic and allow users to interact with the site.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements: A starting point, a condition, and a final statement that allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
