        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You typically use HTML at the beginning to give structure.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage. They can include text, image, header, and list elements.</li>
          <li>The common element types that are used to divide and describe a page are Meta-related, content division, and semantic elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The ul. ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You  use CSS to give the content style.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. </li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>git commit -m "text": describes what the commit contains and commits the changes</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: to double check if our local branch is in sync with the base branch. Important to make sure you aren't working on outdated code.</li>
          <li>git push origin branch/name: used to push changes to our remote github branch</li>
